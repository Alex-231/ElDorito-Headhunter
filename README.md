An experimental patch to replace the Territories gamemode with a Headhunter implementation.
Requires some tag changes, I may share these later.

Disclaimer:
I had little understanding of the game engine, and this was a project for me to learn more, as such my patches aren't well written. That said, this is a proof of concept, and something that'd be revised before release.
